			<p>My love for soccer has shaped my life in the most amazing ways ever since I can remember. 
			Soccer has always been my constant companion, whether I'm playing a game of soccer in my neighborhood or competing in school competitions. 
			I'm happy to report that my passion for the game has led to exciting new college experiences. It's a dream come true for me to play collegiate soccer. 
			It's a big part of who I am, it is no longer simply a sport. 
			My enthusiasm is still fueled by the excitement of the game, the adrenaline on the field, and the teamwork among teammates. 
			I'm achieving my dream, and I'm eager to see where my soccer career will lead me next.

			I feel incredibly blessed to attend Shaw University, a place that has become my second home and a hub of endless opportunities.
			The faculty members are not just educators but mentors, guiding me through the intricate world of coding and technology. 
			Every day, I am inspired by my peers, each as passionate and driven as the next. 
			As I navigate my way through classes, projects, and internships, I am filled with excitement about the knowledge I will gain and the doors that will open as a result. 
			I am truly grateful for this opportunity and can't wait to see where this journey in computer science takes me.
