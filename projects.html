			<p>Unfortunately, I haven't yet embarked on any personal coding projects, and I can't help but feel a bit of regret about it. 
			However, this realization has only fueled my determination to change that soon. 
			With the knowledge and skills I've acquired through my coursework, I am eager to dive into the world of personal coding projects. 
			The exciting part is that I have a list of ideas and concepts buzzing in my mind, waiting to be transformed into lines of code. 
			There's a sense of anticipation and eagerness building up within me as I plan to roll up my sleeves and get started. 
			Whether it's building a useful app, exploring a new programming language, or contributing to open-source projects, I am determined to take the first step.
			I know that personal coding projects are not only valuable learning experiences but also avenues for creativity and innovation. 
			So, stay tuned because big things are on the horizon, and I can't wait to share them with the world.</p>
